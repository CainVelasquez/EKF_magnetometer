# EKF_magnetometer

This was written during my stay at the Kitakyushi Institute of Technology in Fukuoka, Japan.
The BIRDS-4 Detumbling maneuver failed and I created this Extended Kalman Filter forumation as an attempt to estimate
anguler velocity from only mangetometer data so that we could compare with a potentially broken angular velocity sensor.

To run:

python clean_ekf.py
